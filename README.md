# qrCode
QR Code Generator
Overview
This project uses a QR Code generator from a public github repo. The original code turns text and prints into a qr code 
in the console.

This project builds off of that code by taking in 4 command line arguments and outputting a QR Code for a URL and saving
as an SVG file. 
The command line arguments are the URL, output file path, background color, and a bit color for the QR code. 

This project was also meant to embed an image into the QR code, but I was not able to figure it out in time / without
hard coding it.
